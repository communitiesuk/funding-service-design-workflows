Copilot is used for the deployment of the infrastructure configuration, which is all stored under the copilot folder in each service repository. The manifest files have been pre-generated by running through various initialisation steps that create the manifest files by prompting a series of questions, but do not _deploy_ the infrastructure.

For each AWS account, these commands will need to be run _once_ to initialise the environment:

`copilot app init pre-award` - this links the pre-award app with the current service, and associates the next commands with the service. Essentially, this provides context for the service to run under

```bash
    copilot init \
    --name <service-name> \
    --app pre-award \
    --type 'Backend Service' \
    --image 'ghcr.io/communitiesuk/<image-name>:latest' \
    --port 80
```

This will initalise this service, using the current created image
